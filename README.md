# Portfos

This repository serves as a collection of different versions and types of portfolio projects. Each portfolio is organized into its own separate folder within the repository. This structure allows for easy management, comparison, and evolution of various portfolio designs and implementations over time.

- Common assets, documentation, or shared resources can be placed at the root or in dedicated folders as needed.

## How to Use

2. Refer to the README (if available) inside each portfolio folder for specific setup and usage instructions.
3. Feel free to use, modify, or extend any of the portfolios for your own needs.
